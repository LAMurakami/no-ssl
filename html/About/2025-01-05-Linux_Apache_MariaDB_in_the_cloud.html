<h2><span id="About_LAM_AWS">About LAM AWS</span></h2>
<p>My main LAM AWS instance is a Dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) web server, ssh proxy and ssh tunnel server.  This main instance is currently required for a number of IPv6 workarounds I use to initialize an instance without a public IPv4 address.  It is also used as an ssh proxy by my laptop, which currently does not have a public IPv6 address, for access to servers with only IPv6 connectivity.  Since August of 2024 the main LAM AWS server instance provides access to my main git remote repo store.
</p><p>This Linux Apache MariaDB (LAM) instance is in the cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers.  I currently run my main instance in the Oregon (US West 2 region) which is one of the cheapest regions for AWS pricing.  The inclusion of support for the Perl, Python and PHP application programming languages makes this a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> model web service software stack instance.
</p><p>The LAM AWS server instance was created to host my public named host websites and be a backup of the mediawiki installation and home grown perl database web interface on the secure side of my main server.  These utilize a MariaDB server on the same machine.  The server is also used as an ssh proxy for browsing the web.
</p><p>The main server instance is now running on a t4g.nano instance under an all upfront cost 36 month reservation.  This prorates to less than  $1.50 / month which is a considerable savings over the On Demand rate.  The t4g.nano instance 36 month reservation covers 1 EC2 instance but does not include any EC2 EBS storage which is required for the Ubuntu Server image used for the Operating System.  I pay $0.80 for 8 GB-Mo of General Purpose SSD (gp2) which is the standard configuration for the Latest Ubuntu Server image.  I pay $0.30 for 1 GB-Mo of storage on the us-west-2 Oregon AWS Elastic File System (<a href="/a/Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)#Elastic_File_System_(EFS)" title="Amazon Web Services (AWS)">EFS</a>) at the USD $0.30 per GB-Mo for Standard storage (USW2) rate.  The AWS EFS storage is among the most expensive but it is extremely convenient to have a <a href="#Use_a_persistent_parallel_file_system">persistent parallel file system</a> that can be mounted with the Linux nfs4 package available during the Instance Initialization.  I pay $5.00 / month for an additional 50 GB-Mo of General Purpose SSD (gp2) for the volume to mirror the /Zz directory.  I have an AWS EFS in all 30 regions I can currently access but the storage is negligible (less than 150K) on every EFS except my main one in the us-west-2 Oregon region.
</p>
<h3><span id="My_main_private_git_remote_store">My main private git remote store</span></h3>
<p>Since August of 2024 the aws.lam1.us instance is my main private git remote store.  This was also when I made GitLab my main public git remote store.  Both the aws.lam1.us instance and GitLab have dual stack IP access supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.  With the proper ssh_config and credentials matching an authorized_keys entry for the git@aws user the following will work:
</p>
<pre>git clone git@aws:&lt;repo&gt;
</pre>
<h3><span id="aws.lam1.us_sites.lam1.us"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://aws.lam1.us">aws.lam1.us</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sites.lam1.us">sites.lam1.us</a></span></h3>
<p>The LAM AWS server instance was initially designed to utilize a t2.micro EC2 instance which is part of the AWS Free Tier offering starting in 2017.  That offering includes 750 Hours / month of a t2.micro Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance which is enough to run one instance 24/7.  The instance can scale up by using a larger and more capable server and other options or scale down to a t4g.nano or other server sizes cheaper than a t2.micro except under the (AWS) Free Tier offering.  Multiple groups of virtual hosts can all run on one server or a separate server can be used for each group or single host.  Once the Free Tier was over the t2.micro server was found to cost less than $12.00 / month with the initial sizing and usage On Demand and less than $2.00 / month using a t3.nano EC2 instance reserved prepaid for 3 years.  The less expensive t3.nano and then t4g.nano instances were tested and found to support the web and proxy services by being my cloud host after t2.micro hours got more expensive than free.  The server is mostly idle although memory usage runs at 75% on a t3.nano and nearly 50% on a t2.micro.
</p><p>A single LAM AWS server instance can host multiple websites, including multiple secure websites, with Apache2 on Linux and includes MariaDB, Perl, Python, PHP and other common development tools.  Additional packages installed support running MediaWiki and more.  The LAM AWS server is built on the latest Ubuntu Server Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with an EBS General Purpose (SSD) Volume.  The resulting image is similar enough to the Linux Mint distribution I use on the newer machines at home and on my laptop so that cloning my MediaWiki and lam databases from the main server to either an aws instance or Linux Mint machine can be done with the same procedure.
</p><p>In 2023 the LAM AWS VPC in the us-west-2 Oregon region was modified with an Amazon provided IPv6 CIDR block and the subnet for each availability zone allocated a subset of the block and configured to automatically assign an IPv6 address to a new instance interface.  In 2024 the  LAM AWS VPC was modified in an additional 29 AWS regions and an EFS created and populated and the cloud-init process enhanced so that instances can be launched with or without a public IPv4 address on either x86 or ARM processor types with any of the latest Debian, Ubuntu or Amazon Linus operating system AMIs.  As of 2024 the us-west-2 Oregon region is where my main instance runs and is the only AWS instance that has the additional 50 GB-Mo of General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume to mirror the /Zz directory.  The us-west-2 Oregon efs is the only one populated with the git repositories of the remote and all the initialization files.  Until 2024 the us-west-2 Oregon region was the only one where I operated.
</p><p>In 2024 I modified the web configuration so that my public named host websites default to https although I still support them with the http protocol.  Before 2024 only the lam site with the mediawiki and other Private was served over the Secure extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol which originally used SSL encryption and now uses TLS encryption.  I did this because I noticed my phone browser would default to the https protocol and made it more difficult for me to view the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cabo.lam1.us/Weeks">cabo.lam1.us/Weeks</a> website and I decided I agree that all sites should be served over an encrypted protocol.

<h3><span id="Public_IPv4_Address">Public IPv4 Address</span></h3>
<p>Since 2023 the main aws.lam1.us instance supports dual stack access via IPv4 and IPv6.  It is the main workaround allowing the initialization of a LAM AWS instance without a public IPv4 address.
</p><p>AWS started charging for a Public IPv4 Address in February of 2024.  This doubled the cost of running one of it's smallest EC2 instances.
</p>
<ul><li>Charges for In-use public IPv4 address <a rel="nofollow" href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing">took effect on February 1, 2024</a>.</li>
<li>Hourly charge for In-use Public IPv4 Address $0.005 / hour = $0.12 / Day ~= $3.60 / Month ~= $43.80 / Year</li></ul>
<pre>PublicIPv4='--no-associate-public-ip-address' # No Public IPv4 address
PublicIPv4='--associate-public-ip-address' # Public IPv4 address costs $43.80/Year
</pre>
<p>In 2023, when I found out AWS would begin charging for each public IPv4 address, I enabled a default IPv6 address from the 2600:1f14:3d86:2c00::/56 CIDR block for EC2 instance launched in my us-west-2 AWS LAM VPC and modified the aws-web-anywhere-alt-ssh-port Security Group to allow for IPv6 traffic.  Because the ISP I use in Alaska does not yet support IPv6 and I don't know that any are available I must continue to use a Public IPv4 address for my main LAM AWS VPC EC3 instance.  I detailed all 30 of the Amazon provided /56 IPv6 CIDR blocks for my VPC in each region in the <a href="/a/Modify_AWS_VPC_for_IPv6" title="Modify AWS VPC for IPv6">Modify AWS VPC for IPv6</a> page I created.
</p><p>I found that the public IPv4 addresses AWS optionally provided for an EC2 instance are implemented as NAT (Network Address Translation) at the gateway.
</p>
<h3><span id="Use_a_predefined_security_group">Use a predefined security group</span></h3>
<p>The security group definition controls the traffic within the Virtual Private Cloud and with the outside world.  I use the same security group definition for all EC2 images with only a limited number of inbound ports open.  The definition details are:
</p>
<ul><li>GroupName - aws-web-anywhere</li>
<li>Inbound Port 2049 TCP Rule - NFS for EFS - 172.31.0.0/16</li>
<li>Inbound Port 22 TCP Rule - SSH from VPC - 172.31.0.0/16 &amp; 2600:1f14:3d86:2c00::/56 &amp; more LAM VPC IPv6 CIDR blocks</li>
<li>Inbound Port 25 TCP Rule - SMTP - 0.0.0.0/0 &amp;&#160;::/0</li>
<li>Inbound Port 80 TCP Rule - HTTP - 0.0.0.0/0 &amp;&#160;::/0</li>
<li>Inbound Port 443 TCP Rule - HTTPS or SSH on an Alternate port - 0.0.0.0/0 &amp;&#160;::/0</li>
<li>Inbound Port 2222 Custom TCP Rule - SSH on an Alternate port - 0.0.0.0/0 &amp;&#160;::/0</li>
<li>Inbound Port 55520 Custom TCP Rule - SSH on an Alternate port - 0.0.0.0/0 &amp;&#160;::/0</li>
<li>Inbound Port 55593 Custom TCP Rule - IMAPS on an Alternate port - 0.0.0.0/0</li>
<li>Outbound Port 2049 Custom TCP Rule - NFS for EFS - 172.31.0.0/16</li>
<li>Outbound All/All 0.0.0.0/0 &amp;&#160;::/0</li></ul>
<p>This security group definition allows web traffic on the standard ports from the public interface (0.0.0.0/0), Secure Shell on an alternate high numbered port and IMAPS on an alternate high numbered port.  The security group definition allows Secure Shell on the standard port and NFS traffic only on the private interface (172.31.0.0/16) or the IPv6 CIDR block for the VPC.  The SSH SOCKS5 Proxy instance uses the same security group definition but is accepting Secure Shell traffic on the port that is normally used for Secure Web (HTTPS) traffic.  The security group definition does allow outgoing traffic from the server over the public interface over either IPv4 or IPv6.
</p><p>The us-west-2 Oregon has an additional Inbound SSH rule for each of the 30 IPv6 CIDR blocks AWS assigned my VPC for the region.  All 30 of these Inbound SSH rules should be in every region but I skipped adding 26 of the rules to the additional regions when originally configuring them in 2024.
</p><p>A separate EFS security group with just the 172.31.0.0/16 NFS for EFS inbound rule is attached to the interfaces for each Availability Zone in the region when creating the EFS for that region.
</p>
<h3><span id="Use_the_default_VPC_for_the_AWS_Region">Use the default VPC for the AWS Region</span></h3>
<p>The default VPC for the AWS Region includes a default subnet in each Availability Zone providing up to 4,096 addresses per subnet, a few of which are reserved for AWS use.   This gives the LAM AWS VPC it's own private address space (172.31.0.0/16) and each EC2 instance gets an IP address within this space.  The default VPC in each AWS Region also includes an attached internet gateway, a route in the main route table that sends all traffic to the internet gateway, and DNS settings that automatically assign public DNS hostnames to instances with public IP addresses and enable DNS resolution through the Amazon-provided DNS server.
</p>
<pre>KEYPAIR=lam-arsc
</pre>
<p>Prior to my expansion into other regions I had let AWS create an aws-nwo-lam1 key pair and I used that to access instances launched in us-west-2 Oregon.  Quickly I was adding the passphrase protected key pair I have been using on my laptops since working at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://arsc.lam1.us/About">ARSC</a> to every cloud-init file.  The AWS key pairs are managed in the EC2 area of the console and not the VPC area but they are only available in the region that they they are created or imported into.  I decided to import my main key into all the regions which eliminates the need to use the key pair I had ley Amazon create for me in 2017.
</p>
<pre>EFS=value-not-used
</pre>
<p>The EFS name value pair as an AWS instance tag was never utilized during initialization and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lamurakami.github.io/aws-efs/">(AWS) Elastic File System (EFS)</a> directory with a file for each region specifying the EFS name was created on my GitHub pages website instead to allow me to mount the LAM aws-efs for the region the instance was launched in.  I am avoiding using the aws Command Line Interface (CLI) which is not available on an AWS Ubuntu instance without a Public IPv4 address.  The (AWS) Elastic File System (EFS) directory method of configuring the EFS name for a region was replaced with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://gitlab.com/aws-lam/aws/-/blob/master/aws-efs-mount.bash?ref_type=heads">aws/aws-efs-mount.bash script</a> that can be used once git clone is used is used to install the aws repo from the GitLab remote that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 access.

<p>AWS shows the current region at the top of the control panel and the region is a drop down list within geographical groupings.  For me the four regions of the United States are shown first.

<p>Prior to February 2024 when AWS started charging for a public IPv4 address over and above the hourly charge for running the instance I had only started instances in the us-west-2 Oregon region.  In February I created  the <a href="/a/Modify_AWS_VPC_for_IPv6" title="Modify AWS VPC for IPv6">Modify AWS VPC for IPv6</a> page and modified the AWS VPC defaults for a number of regions and activated all the regions that were not previously activated.  One of the steps is to create a security group which is now a parameter of the <a href="/a/Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)#Start_EC2_instance_from_Command_line_specifying_CloudInit,_PublicIPv4_and_more" title="Amazon Web Services (AWS)">aws ec2 run-instances</a> command I use to launch an instance.

<p>There are four regions I don't have access to.  There are two government regions in the US that require a seprate GovCloud account and two regions in China that require a seprate China account.  The two GovCloud regions are US-West and US-East and the two China regions are cn-north-1 China (Beijing) and cn-northwest-1 China (Ningxia).  The above list is all the other AWS regions I know of in 2024 and I have set up a LAM VPC in all with Dual Stack IP configuration and can launch an EC2 instance that intializes as a LAM Alaska Clone with access to the EFS for the region on either an x86 or ARM instance with Debian, Ubuntu or Amazon Linux as the operating system.
</p>
<h3><span id="Use_a_persistent_parallel_file_system">Use a persistent parallel file system</span></h3>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://gitlab.com/aws-lam/aws/-/blob/master/aws-efs-mount.bash?ref_type=heads">aws/aws-efs-mount.bash script</a> was created to mount the LAM aws-efs for the region the instance was launched in.
</p><p>The <a href="/a/Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)#Elastic_File_System_(EFS)" title="Amazon Web Services (AWS)">EFS</a> directory is used by the CloudInit directives during initialization of my AWS EC2 instances.  The nfs-common additional package is required to mount the persistent Amazon Web Services Elastic File System.  Once the nfs-common package is installed the nfs4 mount can be implemented.  Since an additional package is required the mount is performed within the runcmd section and cannot be run earlier in the bootcmd section.
</p><p>NFSv4 uses only one IP port, 2049, to run the service which simplifies controlling access.
</p><p>In 2023 while investigating the internet via IPv4, IPv6 or a dual stack after learning AWS will start charging $43.80 per year for each public IPv4 address in use I found no way to have the EFS resource provisioned with IPv6 addresses.  By default AWS creates a private IPv4 subnet for each availability zone within a region and automatically provisions resource names resolved by DNS to private IPv4 addresses within the subnets.  This is all within the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) created by default for you within a region where you deploy resources.  I was able to modify my VPC for IPv6 but had to run dual stack EC2 instances to access the EFS.  I learned that the public IPv4 addresses AWS can optionally provide for an EC2 instance are implemented as NAT (Network Address Translation) at the gateway.

<h3><span id="Use_a_persistent_48G_General_Purpose_SSD_EBS_volume">Use a persistent 48G General Purpose SSD EBS volume</span></h3>
<p>A second EBS volume was created to hold a copy of my /Zz by Date data in 2020.  This copy is synced daily with the main copy on my AK LAN main server as long as ak20 is available via ssh.  I started a t3.large EC2 instance with 8GiB memory to handle the initial population from the most recent Zz*tgz backup.  The t3.nano I normally run could not handle the initial population task but has no problem with the daily rsync jobs.  The volume is currently 87% utilized and I have already grown it from an original 44G size.  The 48G of EBS costs an additional $4.80 a month and is available to only one EC2 instance.
</p><p>A snapshot of this volume is created daily and retained for 15 days.

<p>I initially created CloudInit directives only for Ubuntu Server and only the x86-64 architecture.  This was originally on x86-64 Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, then x86-64 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, then x86-64 Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and x86-64 Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS.
</p><p>The first variant was the CloudInit directives to have ssh on port 443 instead of https allowing me to setup a SSH SOCKS5 Proxy server on port 443 in some environments such as on hotel / resort Wi-Fi.  This variant does not support the secure site where Mediawiki and other MariaDB web applications live.
</p><p>In 2022 After upgrading to x86-64 Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS I created an x86-64 Amazon Linux 2 initialization.
</p><p>In 2023 I created an x86-64 Amazon Linux 2023 initialization after it became available in March.  I followed in 2023 with ARM Amazon Linux 2023, and ARM Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS initialization scripts.  I then added Debian 12 scripts for both x86-64 and ARM architectures.
</p><p>In 2023 I added the PublicIPv4 option.

<h3><span id="Amazon_Machine_Image_by_Operating_System_.2F_Architecture"></span><span id="Amazon_Machine_Image_by_Operating_System_/_Architecture">Amazon Machine Image by Operating System / Architecture</span></h3>
<p>Amazon Machine Image (AMI)s are available for a number of Operating System / Architecture configurations.  A number of AMIs are supported and maintained by AWS, some provided by the AWS community and custom AMIs can be made.  I could create a custom AMI but instead use a AWS provided AMI provided without additional charge and perform the initialization with the CloudInit directives.  The initialization takes a few minutes but I avoid having to pay for the storage of the AMI as an EBS snapshot.
</p><p>Each AMI is for a Region, Operating system, Architecture, and Storage for the root device.  I use Oregon (US West 2) Region images with an Elastic Block Store (EBS) root device.  I have CloudInit directives for Ubuntu server 22.04, Debian 12, Amazon Linux 2, and Amazon Linux 2023 for both x86 and ARM Architectures.
</p><p>In February of 2024 I started launching instances in other regions of AWS besides the us-west-2 Oregon region where I have been operating since 2017.  Before launching an instance in a new region I <a href="/a/Modify_AWS_VPC_for_IPv6" title="Modify AWS VPC for IPv6">Modify AWS VPC for IPv6</a> since my initial testing is about running an instance with a Public IPv6 address but without a Public IPv4 that AWS is now charging a ludicrous amount for starting this month.  I was testing arm64 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS which has an issue with package management on instances without a Public IPv4 address and decided to see if it affected other images since there is a separate image for each region.
</p><p>For Ubuntu I use the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2">Ubuntu image locator for ec2</a> and search for arm64 and the region to find the latest build for my testing.  The rest of this section has cloud-init files for the us-west-2 Oregon region and are generally updated when new images appear in the Launch instances Quick Start section for selecting the AMI.
</p><p>The AMI_RootDeviceName environment variable is used in the block device mapping parameter of the aws ec2 run-instances command to increase the default Root Device Volume Size.  I am currently specifying 10 GB which is a 25% Increase over the default 8 GB of EBS storage for the root volume. 
</p><p>The following command describes an Amazon Machine image in a specific region:
</p>
<pre>aws ec2 describe-images --image-id ${AMI} --region ${REGION}
</pre>
<p>The AMI_RootDeviceName value should match that used in the AMI for the new Root Device Volume Size to be used.  The following are values I have observed:
</p>
<pre>AMI_RootDeviceName='/dev/sda1' # Ubuntu Noble
AMI_RootDeviceName='/dev/xvda' # Other OS AMIs
</pre>
<p>If the AMI_RootDeviceName value does not match that used in the AMI the instance will still launch but the default 8G root device size will be used rather than the 10G value specified on the command line.
</p>
<h3><span id="LAM_AWS_user-data_is_a_set_of_CloudInit_directives">LAM AWS user-data is a set of CloudInit directives</span></h3>
<p>The LAM AWS server is initialized with CloudInit directives to install the necessary packages, configuration and content on top of a generic Server image.  All the directives in a file can be specified with the user-data parameter or in Advanced Options of the launch page from the AWS web console.  The directives can also be pasted into the text box when using the web console.  The CloudInit package is a great tool for AWS EC2 initialization.

A new image on the default launch image page is tested when it appears and usually can be substituted without any other changes to the new instance initialization.  Some package changes required changes to the new instance initialization when I did the major upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04 from Ubuntu 16.04 but most simply shorten the full upgrade performed during the new instance initialization.

The next 36 months will still include charges for EBS, EFS, and bandwidth but will only include EC2 charges when I run a second server.  The total paid to AWS for the first 15 months of service averages to only $4 / month and since this includes the EC2 reservation good for 35 more months the average will continue to go down.</li></ul></li>
<li>January 13, 2019 Switched aws to t3.nano instance still using Ubuntu Server 18.04 for main 24/7 server
<ul><li>AWS Free tier for t2.micro instance has expired and a t3.nano instance is less expensive and can support the trivial load.</li></ul></li>
<li>Sunday, January 6, 2019 my 12 Month Free-Tier offerings have expired and I pay for a lot more.
<ul><li>I will switch to a t3.nano instead of a t2.micro soon before getting a reserved instance.  I have not decided how long to run on demand instances to see actual billing.</li>
<li>So far it looks like total on demand costs are going to be less than $12.00 / month for the t2.micro and less than $6.00 / month for a t3.nano instance.</li></ul></li>
